# Project Overview
For this midterm project, I chose to create an interactive simulation of the Golden Snitch from the Harry Potter series. The Golden Snitch is a small, winged ball used in the wizarding sport of Quidditch, known for its quick and unpredictable movements.

# The project is both interactive and time-based.
Interactive: Users interact with the Golden Snitch by clicking on it. When clicked, the Snitch reacts by "flying" to a new location.
Time-based: The movement from one position to another is animated, rather than instant, creating a smooth transition that mimics the Snitch’s flight.

# Some key ideas I want to explore and experiment with in this project:
Smooth flight animation: The Snitch will fly in a smooth path when it moves to a new location, creating a realistic flight feel.
Randomized position: Each time the Snitch is clicked, it will move to a random new position on the screen, adding unpredictability and challenge for the user.
Visual effects: I plan to give the Golden Snitch a visually appealing design with wings and shiny, metallic textures to replicate its appearance from the movies.

# Are there aspects of your project that are related to any of the readings we’ve done?
yes!I seem to remember it was the second week's reading assignment on computer vision and art？ >_<
